# Full-Stack-Flight-Booking-System
Full-stack flight booking system built in Java with SQL database, responsive front-end, UML modeling, and JUnit testing. Developed using Spiral & Incremental SDLC.

**Team Size:** 3 members  

- **Requirements Analysis → System Design → Implementation → Testing → Final Demo**  

## Tech Stack  

- **Languages & Tools:** Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Frameworks & Patterns:** MVC, Singleton, Observer  
- **Testing:** JUnit  
- **Modeling & Design:** UML (Use Case, Activity, Class, Sequence Diagrams)  
- **Project Management:** SPMP, Gantt Charts, Risk Analysis  
- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub

##  Current Progress – *End of Phase 1* (Week of Oct 6)  

We have completed **Phase 1: Requirements Analysis**  
- Defined system domain and objectives  
- Identified actors, components, FRs, NFRs, assumptions, glossary  
- Created responsibilities matrix  
- Modeled use cases, scenarios, and activity diagrams  
- Initial traceability matrix setup  
- Drafted Gantt chart with workload allocation and risk buffers

## Skills – Current/In Progress  

### Currently Applied  
- Requirements Engineering (actors, FRs, NFRs, glossary, assumptions)  
- UML Modeling (Use Case, Activity, Scenario diagrams)  
- Project Planning (SPMP draft, Gantt chart, workload allocation)  
- Team collaboration & documentation  

### In-Progress Learning  
- Class Diagrams & System Design (Phase 2 – next step)  
- Applying Design Patterns (MVC, Singleton, Observer)  
- SQL Schema design & database integration  
- Responsive front-end UI (HTML/CSS/JS)  

### Upcoming Focus  
- System Implementation in Java + SQL backend  
- Responsive UI integration  
- Unit Testing with JUnit  
- Final demo & presentation

## Learning Outcomes  

By the end of this project, we will demonstrate:  
- **Full-stack development**: SQL + Java back-end + responsive UI  
- **System design practices**: UML, design patterns, traceability  
- **Quality assurance**: JUnit test cases, structured test plan  
- **Project management & teamwork**: SPMP, Gantt scheduling, final demo
